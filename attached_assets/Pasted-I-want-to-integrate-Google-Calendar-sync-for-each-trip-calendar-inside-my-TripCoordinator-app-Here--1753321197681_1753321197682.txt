I want to integrate Google Calendar sync for each trip calendar inside my TripCoordinator app. Here‚Äôs exactly what I need:

üß† CONTEXT:
- Each trip in the app has its own calendar (with events stored in state or database).
- I want users to be able to connect their Google account and sync all events for that trip to their Google Calendar.
- We‚Äôre using React and Tailwind, and I want the UI to use `shadcn/ui` components.

üåê FUNCTIONALITY TO BUILD:

1. **OAuth Integration** (Google Sign-In):
   - Add a ‚ÄúConnect Google Calendar‚Äù button to each trip‚Äôs calendar page using `shadcn/ui` `Button`.
   - Use **Google OAuth 2.0** to authenticate the user and get permission for:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
   - After login, store the user‚Äôs access token securely (e.g., in auth context, session, or localStorage for now).

2. **Let User Select Their Calendar**:
   - After authentication, fetch the list of calendars (`GET https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList`)
   - Display these in a dropdown using `shadcn/ui` `Select`
   - Let the user choose which calendar to sync to (e.g., ‚ÄúMy Trips Calendar‚Äù)

3. **Sync Events to Google Calendar**:
   - When a user creates or updates an event in the trip calendar, give them the option to also push that event to their selected Google Calendar
   - Use the `events.insert` endpoint:
     `POST https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/{calendarId}/events`
     - Include: summary (title), description, start, end, timezone, and location
   - After successful sync, show a toast or alert (shadcn `Toast` or simple alert)

4. **UI DESIGN**:
   - Add a `Calendar Sync` section at the top or bottom of each trip calendar page.
   - Include:
     - ‚ÄúConnect Google Calendar‚Äù button
     - Dropdown to select which calendar
     - Toggle switch (optional) to auto-sync new events

5. **Security Notes**:
   - Make sure token is handled securely
   - Refresh token logic can be skipped for now unless needed
   - Warn user if token is expired or invalid

üì¶ DEPENDENCIES TO INSTALL:
- `googleapis` (Node.js SDK for Google Calendar API)
- `react-oauth/google` or another OAuth package (or use `gapi` directly if preferred)

üõ†Ô∏è OPTIONAL (Can do later):
- Import events from Google Calendar back into the trip calendar (two-way sync)
- Store calendar ID in the backend so we don‚Äôt have to ask every time

Please implement this step-by-step in a modular way. Start with Google OAuth, then calendar selection, then syncing an individual trip‚Äôs events. You can create a `GoogleCalendarSync.tsx` component if helpful.
