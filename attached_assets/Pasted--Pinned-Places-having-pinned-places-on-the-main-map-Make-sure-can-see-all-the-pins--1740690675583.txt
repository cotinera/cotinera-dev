    - [ ] having pinned places on the main map - Make sure can see all the pins in all maps of a trip
    - [ ] default to trip destination instead of nyc on adding pinned place
    - [ ] Larger map in ‘add pin’ popup box
    - [ ] Depending on what kind of category of place somewhere is, it has a different looking/color of pin
    - [ ] When you click on a location in the “Pinned Places” section have it zoom into that location you chose on the map above.

    - [x] easily accessible notes within a pinned place
    - [x] deleting/modifying pinned places
- [ ] Miscellaneous
    - [ ] Information about location can appear in a sidebar like in google maps. Check how competitors that use maps do it
        - [ ] Map is overall useless — it isn’t like actual google maps where you can accurately search for stuff (it saves your shit) we want the app version of google maps preloaded as an API the one we have is slightly useless  — add Places UI kit and test which API key to use with replit agent see if it works. 
    - [ ] The default dates for a person within a trip should be the trip dates. The default dates when adding a new step to a trip should be the end of the last step
    - [ ] Fix image generation when creating a new trip. — it’s fucked.
    - [ ] no homepage exists for new users
        - [ ] On homepage search bar, should get autofill location e.g. London, UK. Also have bigger location box and smaller people selection
    - [ ] issue of one day back when editing dates within a trip
    - [ ] Add functionality in share link === apple share when it goes to whatsapp popup
    - [ ] locations of calendar events should create pins on the map api
    - [ ] checklist should have delete button in addition to edit button
    - [ ] Polls in the chat for people to vote - fix errors
    - [ ] Once for example an airbnb has been booked by the main leading person - how does this booked and paid status show up on the trips page - both the fact it’s booked and how much different people have paid for thing. Should there be key highlighted items in the checklist like booking places with have status button of done, to-do, etc.
    - [ ] How does airbnb do adding people to the trip functionality
    - [ ] Have the ability to export the trip as a PDF itinerary
    - [x] Ability to delete trip in My Trips page and ability to select several at a time
    - [x] chat functionality?   —— Chat default prompt text should be: add any links, ideas, and information here! (Instead of having API’s from sky scanner etc at the start) —  hopefully we can maintain live web links in the chatbox 
- [ ] Trip Timeline / Destination Dropdown
    - [ ] The directions links on the map between points should include all stops
    - [ ] Make sure deleting/adding destinations/stops in a trip is constant and updated across drop-down and trip timeline
    - [ ] Fix scrolling in dropdown for destinations
    - [ ] Date of overall trip should reflect combination of all stops/destinations
    - [ ] Should have directions/multipath on initial top page of a mulittrip - then within each stop it should just show the location
    - [ ] On which stop should locations from specific calendar events and bookings appear?
    - [ ] Have the ability to delete stops within a trip in the top right destinations drop down
- [ ] People Section of a trip
    - [ ] adding people/flight info.  —— under the drop down when you try to add a person it doesnt come up with hotel/ flights/ etc only comes up with a few. 
    - [ ] There is an error message failing to update a participant's information if the airline, flight number, or hotel inputs are filled in
    - [ ] When someone is added to a trip via share link, they should automatically be added to the people list - how do we track this distinction between the people list additions and people that are/arent added to the trip via share
