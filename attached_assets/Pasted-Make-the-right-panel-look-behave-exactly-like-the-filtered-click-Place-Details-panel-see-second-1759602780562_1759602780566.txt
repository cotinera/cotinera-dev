Make the right panel look/behave exactly like the filtered → click → Place Details panel (see second screenshot) for:

Roam & click (clicking any marker without first filtering)

Pinned places

Filtered results (already correct)

Do:

Create a single component PlaceDetailsPanel and reuse it for all three paths.

Always fetch data by place_id via Places getDetails with fields:
["place_id","name","formatted_address","geometry","rating","user_ratings_total","price_level","opening_hours","photos","website","international_phone_number","url","types"]

If roam/pinned selection starts with only lat/lng or partial data, resolve place_id first (findPlace/nearby), then render the panel.

Adopt the “second image” layout (exact spec):

Top: full-width photo carousel (arrows, dots, count; hide controls if <2). Uses Details → photos (no Street View unless photos empty). Show attributions.

Header row: name (bold), category, rating ★ + reviews count, price chips.

Meta row: address (with icon), Open/Closed + collapsible Hours.

Action grid (2×2): Select, Call, Website, Share.

Include Save/Unsave (bookmark) in the header area.

For pinned items, include Add to Itinerary in the grid (or as primary just below grid), and a compact Marker icon picker (popover) — match styling.

Tokens: same spacing, radius, shadows, fonts as the filtered panel.

Remove / replace legacy UIs:

Delete the old pinned layout (three small photos strip, standalone “Pin to Trip” slab, big “Choose an icon” block).

Replace roam & click popups with PlaceDetailsPanel (no alternate style).

Behavior:

Selecting any marker or list item opens this same panel; do not over-zoom the map (light pan only).

Keep our existing photo caching + detailsRequestId and error handling.

Save/Unsave syncs with Pinned Places immediately.

Acceptance checks:

Clicking a marker (no filter), clicking a pinned place, or clicking a filtered result all open the identical panel (carousel, header, actions, hours).

Price chips, rating, and address appear in the same positions/styles across all paths.

“Add to Itinerary” + marker-icon picker are present for pinned items within the unified panel styling.

No legacy pinned/roam layouts remain; no console errors; performance unchanged.
