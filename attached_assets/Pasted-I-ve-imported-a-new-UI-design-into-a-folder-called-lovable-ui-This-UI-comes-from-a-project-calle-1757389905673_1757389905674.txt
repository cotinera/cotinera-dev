Iâ€™ve imported a new UI design into a folder called `lovable-ui/`. This UI comes from a project called Lovable and it includes modern layouts, styling, and component structure.

My goal is to replace the entire current UI of this app with the Lovable UI while preserving all the functionality from my original app, which includes:

- Trip Dashboard (Your Trips page)
- Trip Detail Page (with trip info, participants, ideas, and checklist)
- Calendar (with Google Calendar Sync)
- Budget Tracker (Spending tab)
- Group Chat
- Navigation between all of these

ðŸŽ¯ Hereâ€™s what I want you to do:

1. **Use the Lovable UI layout and components** from the `lovable-ui/` folder as the new base
   - Replace the old layout/pages/components with the Lovable design equivalents
   - Apply global styles from the Lovable Tailwind setup (`tailwind.config.ts` and any themes)

2. **Wrap all my existing logic and feature components** inside the Lovable layout system
   - Example: wrap `TripCalendar.tsx` or `TripChecklist.tsx` inside Lovableâ€™s layout shell
   - If needed, move reusable components (like buttons, modals) into the Lovable style system

3. **Use Lovableâ€™s homepage as the new Your Trips page**
   - Replace the current trip card grid with Lovableâ€™s design
   - Make sure trip title, location, dates, and actions (edit/view/delete) are all shown correctly

4. **Update routing/navigation** to use Lovableâ€™s top nav or sidebar (whichever it uses)
   - Make all pages (dashboard, calendar, budget, map, etc.) reachable through Lovableâ€™s nav

5. **Ensure mobile responsiveness and polished design**
   - Use the same spacing, shadows, and color gradients Lovable uses
   - Remove default or stock UI elements that look like vanilla Tailwind or shadcn

ðŸ“¦ Notes:
- All Lovable components are inside the `lovable-ui/` folder
- Feel free to move whatâ€™s needed to `components/` or `app/` to complete the transition
- Do this modularly â€” update one page at a time and reuse layouts where possible

This should result in a visually beautiful, responsive, and cohesive travel planner using the Lovable design but powered by my original app logic.
