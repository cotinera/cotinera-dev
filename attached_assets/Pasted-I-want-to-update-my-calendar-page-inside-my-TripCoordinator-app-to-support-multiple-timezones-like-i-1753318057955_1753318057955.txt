I want to update my calendar page inside my TripCoordinator app to support multiple timezones like in Notion's calendar. Here‚Äôs what I need you to do:

üß† CONTEXT:
- The calendar currently shows only the trip days (e.g., May 18‚Äì24), which is fine and should stay that way.
- I want to display the calendar with **two side-by-side timezones** (e.g., local user time and trip destination time).
- I also want to give the user the ability to **select both timezones from dropdown menus**.

üé® DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use `shadcn/ui` components for the dropdowns (specifically `Select`, `SelectTrigger`, `SelectContent`, and `SelectItem`)
- Timezone dropdowns should appear above the calendar grid
- Label the dropdowns as ‚ÄúTrip Timezone‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour Timezone‚Äù

‚öôÔ∏è FUNCTIONALITY:
1. By default, ‚ÄúTrip Timezone‚Äù should be set to the timezone of the trip destination (e.g., Europe/Paris).
2. ‚ÄúYour Timezone‚Äù should default to the user‚Äôs local timezone (e.g., America/Los_Angeles).
3. Display a calendar grid with times listed vertically (hourly), and two columns horizontally:
   - First column: Trip timezone
   - Second column: User timezone
4. For each row, show the corresponding time in each timezone (i.e., 9:00 AM in Trip timezone and what that time is in User timezone).
5. Use `date-fns` and `date-fns-tz` for timezone handling and formatting.
6. Make sure the times update automatically if the dropdown selections change.

üì¶ DEPENDENCIES TO INSTALL:
- `date-fns` and `date-fns-tz` if not already installed

üìå KEEP IN MIND:
- This is just Step 1. You don‚Äôt need to show trip events yet ‚Äî just the visual hourly calendar with dual timezones and selectable timezones.
- Make the layout responsive and styled cleanly using Tailwind + shadcn.

Please implement this directly in the calendar page component. If any existing logic needs to be modified or split into components for clarity, go ahead and do so.
‚úÖ What This Will Do:
Tell Replit AI to add dual timezones using dropdowns

Structure the calendar so it's Notion-like with time conversion rows

Stick with clean shadcn/ui components

Not overcomplicate anything for now ‚Äî no event handling yet

Once that works, I can help you with Step 2: rendering scheduled events across both timezones on the grid.

Let me know when you're ready for that.

now i want to create a feature where instead of the user clicking on a 1 hour timeblock in the calendar to create an event, they can drag the starting point and ending point of the event as you can do in notion calendar (see image i attached the light blue block was me clicking at 3pm and dragging to 5pm to create an event in that timeblock) and google calendar. write me the prompt for replit to execute this. use shadcdn components to make it look nice

Perfect ‚Äî now we‚Äôre adding drag-to-create functionality for events in the calendar, just like Notion or Google Calendar. Here's a clean and scoped Replit AI prompt you can paste in directly:

Edit
I want to upgrade my calendar view in the TripCoordinator app to support creating events by dragging across time blocks, similar to how it works in Notion or Google Calendar.

üß† CONTEXT:
- The calendar currently shows hourly rows for each day of the trip.
- Right now, the only way to create an event is by clicking a single time block and entering details. I want to change that.
- I‚Äôm using Tailwind and `shadcn/ui` components in the rest of the app, so make sure the UI stays clean and consistent.

üß≤ NEW FUNCTIONALITY TO ADD:
1. **User Interaction**:
   - User should be able to click and drag vertically across time blocks within a day to select a range (e.g., 3PM‚Äì5PM).
   - On mouse release, show an event creation modal or inline form (whichever is simpler) with the selected start/end times pre-filled.
   - The user should then be able to name the event and save it.

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - While dragging, highlight the selected time range with a translucent block (like Google/Notion).
   - Use a soft blue or violet background and rounded corners for the selection area using Tailwind styles.

3. **Design System**:
   - Use `shadcn/ui` components for the event creation modal or inline form:
     - Use `Dialog`, `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Button` from shadcn/ui.
     - Make sure the modal feels native to the design already in place.

4. **Event Saving**:
   - After saving, render the new event block inside the calendar grid (same visual style as existing ones if any).
   - The event block should show the event title and time range.
   - Make the event blocks styled cleanly with Tailwind (rounded, drop shadow, hover effect).

üß† TECHNICAL:
- Make sure drag events don‚Äôt interfere with scroll.
- Ensure it works on both desktop and mobile (basic responsive layout is fine).
- Use React state to track startTime and endTime while dragging.
- Store events in local state for now or wherever we currently store them.
- Bonus if you can snap to nearest 30-min or 1-hour intervals while dragging.

üì¶ KEEP:
- The calendar only needs to support this for one day column at a time for now.
- Keep using the existing scrollable grid of hours/day ‚Äî just inject this behavior on top of it.

Please implement this logic directly into the calendar component. Refactor into smaller components if necessary.
