I want to upgrade my calendar view in the TripCoordinator app to support creating events by dragging across time blocks, similar to how it works in Notion or Google Calendar.

ðŸ§  CONTEXT:
- The calendar currently shows hourly rows for each day of the trip.
- Right now, the only way to create an event is by clicking a single time block and entering details. I want to change that.
- Iâ€™m using Tailwind and `shadcn/ui` components in the rest of the app, so make sure the UI stays clean and consistent.

ðŸ§² NEW FUNCTIONALITY TO ADD:
1. **User Interaction**:
   - User should be able to click and drag vertically across time blocks within a day to select a range (e.g., 3PMâ€“5PM).
   - On mouse release, show an event creation modal or inline form (whichever is simpler) with the selected start/end times pre-filled.
   - The user should then be able to name the event and save it.

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - While dragging, highlight the selected time range with a translucent block (like Google/Notion).
   - Use a soft blue or violet background and rounded corners for the selection area using Tailwind styles.

3. **Design System**:
   - Use `shadcn/ui` components for the event creation modal or inline form:
     - Use `Dialog`, `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Button` from shadcn/ui.
     - Make sure the modal feels native to the design already in place.

4. **Event Saving**:
   - After saving, render the new event block inside the calendar grid (same visual style as existing ones if any).
   - The event block should show the event title and time range.
   - Make the event blocks styled cleanly with Tailwind (rounded, drop shadow, hover effect).

ðŸ§  TECHNICAL:
- Make sure drag events donâ€™t interfere with scroll.
- Ensure it works on both desktop and mobile (basic responsive layout is fine).
- Use React state to track startTime and endTime while dragging.
- Store events in local state for now or wherever we currently store them.
- Bonus if you can snap to nearest 30-min or 1-hour intervals while dragging.

ðŸ“¦ KEEP:
- The calendar only needs to support this for one day column at a time for now.
- Keep using the existing scrollable grid of hours/day â€” just inject this behavior on top of it.

Please implement this logic directly into the calendar component. Refactor into smaller components if necessary.
